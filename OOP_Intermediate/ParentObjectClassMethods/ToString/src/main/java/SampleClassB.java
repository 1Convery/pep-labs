/**
 * A toString method should contain some useful information about the object. A toString is useful for printing/logging
 * information about an object.
 *
 * Like equals, all Objects inherit toString from the parent Object class, by default it is not very useful (you may
 * have seen the default implementation before if you tried to print an object and got random letters and numbers.)
 * So, we must override the inherited method by writing a toString method in this class.
 *
 * for instance, the method
 * public String toString(){
 *     //code here
 * }
 * will override the default toString() method. The String that is returned is the String representation of this object.
 *
 * The test cases here will check if the toString contains information about the fields of this object. Essentially,
 * you just need to append them to the String that is returned by toString. The string may be formatted in any way.
 *
 * In the future, your IDE should have a way to automatically generate constructors, getters, setters, equals, and
 * toString.
