/**
 * Let's see if we can answer questions about the 3 new entities discussed in README.MD.
 * Please review README.md the SuperHero.java class and answer the questions below.
 *
 * You will have to replace the "type your answer here" with a different answer, in quotations.
 * For instance: if the question is, 'what programming language are we learning?', the answer should be formatted as
 * String answer = "Java".
 *
 * In order to check your answers, you should run the test cases in QuestionsTest.java by using the test runner provided
 * by your IDE. (in Intellij, that is the green button at the left of main methods and test cases, in GitPod/vscode,
 * that is represented by the flask icon to the left of the screen, which will open the VSCode Java test runner plugin.)
 * The test cases are not case-sensitive, should ignore spaces at the beginning/end of answers, and should accept all
 * reasonable answers to questions.
 *
 * If you get stuck on a question, the test cases also contain the answers. However, just copying the test cases
 * won't work once we are working on more serious programming problems.
