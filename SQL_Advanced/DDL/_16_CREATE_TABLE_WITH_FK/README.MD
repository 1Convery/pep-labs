# Foreign Key Constraint
We know how to create simple tables. 
Now we need to relate these tables to each other. This is a crucial part
of relational databases. Foreign keys are used to link tables together, and
to enforce referential integrity.

A foreign key is a column in a table which matches another column in another table.
The most common way this is done is to match the foreign key column to the primary 
key in another table.

For example we have two tables, artists and songs.
